I am a software engineer currently working in the Developer Technology Division at NVIDIA. My focus involves performance optimization for workloads running on GPU accelerated computing systems. Prior to this I was a student at University of California, San Diego (Go Tritons!) where I earned my M.S. CS degree in '23.

I am most interested in solving problems in software where I have to care about the hardware it is running on.
