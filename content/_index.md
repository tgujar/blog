Hello, and welcome to my corner of the internet!

This blog is mostly an outlet for technical and sometimes philosophical posts. I intend this to be a more polished version of my notes where I consolidate a few ideas under one post. Putting it on the internet drives me to organize my thoughts clearly, and doing so helps me see the forest through the trees.

Contents of the blog reflect my personal opinions, and all the writing for the posts is done in my free time. I never write on behalf of my employer on this blog.
